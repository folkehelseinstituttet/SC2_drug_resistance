Code for identifying resistance mutations in Sars-Cov-2 against 3CLpro and RdRp based on the [Stanford Sars-Cov-2 database](https://covdb.stanford.edu/drms/rdrp/)  

Currently only the `create_BN_import.R` script is relevant. Also, we only create a BN import file for 3Clpro mutations. Although the code can be used to identify any RdRP resistance mutations as well.
